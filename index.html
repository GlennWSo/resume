      <h2 id="bio">About Me</h2>
      <p>Glenn is a passionate software developer, he even codes electric sheep
        to fall asleep. His multidisciplinary background helps him understand the needs
        and challenges that people of different backgrounds face. This makes him an
        excellent developer, tech-lead and team-player. </p>

      <h5>For the impatient reader:</h5>
      <p> He can help you with anything from writing firmware in Rust to
        machine learning in Python. Glenn has great math skills and uses
        those to solve problems related to 3D graphics, modeling and physics
        simulations.</p>

      <h5>Bio:</h5>
      <p> He started his carrier as mechanical engineer, but has now changed tracks to software
        development. The reason behind this change was simple, he loves to create
        and to iterate fast! Glenn found his love for programing when he studied
        optimization and automation of mechanical design. Now his strongest
        language is Python, but he prefers to use Rust whenever possible. </p>
