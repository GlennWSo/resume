## About Me
---

I'm a mechanical engineer and a system developer.
My multidisciplinary background helps me understand the needs
and challenges that people of different backgrounds face. This makes me an
excellent problem-solver and team-player. 


#### Background:
I started out as a mechanical engineer, but I have since then broadened my competence to include electronics and software.
The reason behind this change was simple, I love to create things
and learn about new technologies.  Through my experience I have realized what I love the
most is tinkering on electrical systems and to iterate on software.
