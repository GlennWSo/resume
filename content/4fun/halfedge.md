I have been frustrated with available libraries for rust and python for boolean operations on 3D-models.
Therefore I started this project that aims to provide an opensoruce rust library with python bindings. The ambition is to provide robust boolean operations on halfedge datastructres.
The project is heavly inspired by the white paper: [Exact, robust, and efficient regularized Booleans on general 3D meshes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0898122115003028).
