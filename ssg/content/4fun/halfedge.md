Glenn have been frustrated with availble libraries for rust and python for boolean operations on 3D-models.
This project aims to provide a opensoruce rust lib with python bindings. The goal is to provide robust boolean operations on halfedge datastructres.
The project is heavly inspired by [Exact, robust, and efficient regularized Booleans on general 3D meshes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0898122115003028).
