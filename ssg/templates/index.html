  <h2 id="bio">About Me</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>Glenn is a mechanical engineer and a self-taught software developer.
  His multidisciplinary background helps him understand the needs
    and challenges that people of different backgrounds face. This makes him an
    excellent developer, communicator and team-player. </p>

  <p> He can help you with <em>anything</em> from writing firmware in Rust to
    machine learning in Python. Glenn has great math skills and uses
    those to solve problems related to 3D graphics, modeling and physics
    simulations.</p>

  <h4>Background:</h4>
  <p> He started his carrier as mechanical engineer, but has now changed tracks towards software
    development. The reason behind this change was simple, he loves to create things and learning about new technologies.
    Glenn was drawn to software development because it allows for faster iterations.
    Just compile and you get new a prototype! Even rust compiles faster than a 3D-printer! 
  </p>
  <p>  
    Glenn found his love for programming when he studied optimization and automation of mechanical design.
    While he has more experience using python, he prefers to use Rust whenever possible. Having used mypy in larger projects, 
    Glenn much prefers to have strong typing built into the language itself.
